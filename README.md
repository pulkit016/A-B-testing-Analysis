In this project, I conducted a comprehensive A/B test analysis on two marketing campaigns - the Control Campaign and the Test Campaign. Utilizing Python, I delved into crucial metrics to determine the effectiveness of each campaign in achieving our marketing goals. I was just scrolling through kaggle where I got this dataset and problem statement and I tried to implement my python learnings in it.





Key Findings:

1-The Control Campaign gained more impressions per amount spent compared to the Test Campaign.

2- The Test Campaign led to more searches on the website and higher website clicks.

3- Despite fewer website clicks, the Control Campaign resulted in higher engagement with more content views and products added to the cart.

4- While the Test Campaign had a higher expenditure, the Control Campaign generated more sales, indicating greater efficiency.



Insights:

- The Control Campaign demonstrated superiority in overall sales and engagement metrics, making it suitable for broader marketing purposes.

- Conversely, the Test Campaign showcased a higher conversion rate, suggesting its potential for targeted marketing efforts to specific products or audiences.





Through Good A/B testing, can unearthed actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies. By leveraging the strengths of each campaign, we can make our approach to maximize ROI and better resonate with our target audience.



I am excited to delve deeper into the realm of data-driven marketing strategies and continuously expanding my knowledge in implementing advanced data analytics and data science techniques to extract more precise and impactful insights.
